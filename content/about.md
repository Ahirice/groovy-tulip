## What is Monolith?

Monolith is an Ethereum-powered solution allowing you to spend your ETH and ERC-20 in real-life, the way you're used to: with a debit card accepted anywhere.

> You are the one and only in control of the assets stored in your contract wallet

Monolith cards are paired with a non-custodial contract wallet to secure crypto assets to the best of current technical possibilities. **You are the one and only in control of the assets stored in your contract wallet**. Each of our users deploys their own instance of the [Monolith contract wallet](https://github.com/tokencard/contracts).

Users can set up a whitelist as well as daily spending limits to protect their assets, even if their wallet was to be compromised, without compromising on the solution's usability.

| Service | Countries Served | Fee |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Monolith Wallet | All 🌍 | None (Ethereum Network Fees) |
| Monolith Card | Europe (EEA) 🇪🇺 | 1-2% for top-ups, none for card usage in local currency |

### 💳 How do I get a card?

The cards are already available and shipping to the UK, and most other European countries: **all 31 countries of the EEA.** All your interactions with the Monolith Wallet and Card are done using your phone.

Our app is available on iPhone 6 and up from running iOS >=12, and Android >=7.0 (Nougat).

### Which tokens are supported?

Our wallet supports all ERC-20 tokens that are fully compliant with the standard.

You can currently top-up your card with:

| ETH | TKN | USDC | MKR | DGX | DGD |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| KNC | RLC | GUSD | DAI | USDT | MATIC |

### Does the Monolith Visa Card supports ...?

| SERVICE | APPLE PAY | GOOGLE PAY | VERIFIED BY VISA | CURVE |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| WORKS WITH MONOLITH CARD | ❌ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |

_Verified by Visa is sometimes referred as 3D-SECURE_

### Is it expensive? What are the fees?

The fees are kept to a minimum. There is no setup fee, no activation fee, nor domestic point of sale fees. The only usage fee users have to cover is a 1% top-up fee and potentially another 1% licensing fee, depending on the token used. Here is an [overview of our fee structure](https://support.monolith.xyz/hc/en-us/articles/360001403598).

| Item | Fee |
| --- | --- |
| Monthly Fee | 0 |
| Card Activation & Shipping | 0 |
| Transaction Fee | 1% |
| License Fee (->Community Chest) | 1% |

|  | Domestic Fee | Europe Fee | International Fee |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Payment at Merchant | 0% | 1.75 % | 1.75 % |
| ATM Withdrawal | Free up to 2/month, then £0.75  / €0.85 per withdrawal | £1.20 / €1.50 (e.g. if in a UK ATM with € card) | £1.75 / €2.00 |

The licensing fees collected populate the community chest, which is where it gets really exciting!

### Where are my funds stored with Monolith?

> The [source code of the wallet](https://github.com/tokencard/contracts) is not only open-source (GPL3); it's also thoroughly documented to make sure each of our users can understand the functions they interact with daily.

Monolith provides you with a non-custodial Ethereum Contract Wallet. Don't panic; let's unpack this:

1. Your wallet is non-custodial: **you and only you** have access to the private key, required to sign off transactions. Yay! Freedom, autonomy and sovereignty. However, it also means that you have the responsibility of securing your private key.
2. It's a contract wallet - your funds are not stored in a "regular" (EOA) Ethereum account. Instead, you have the private key of an EAO that governs a smart contract, where your funds are stored. It allows for the implementation of another layer of security: a logic as to how your funds can move.

3. It's an Ethereum wallet - able to store ETH, ERC-20 tokens, and soon NFTs!

The [source code of the wallet](https://github.com/tokencard/contracts) is not only open-source (GPL3); it's also thoroughly documented to make sure each of our users can understand the functions they interact with daily.

Worried about smart contract failures? The code of our contract wallet has been [audited several times](https://github.com/tokencard/contracts/tree/master/audits) by companies including Trail of Bits & New Alchemy).

### What is TKN and Community Chest?

> Every time one of our users top-up his card with any token other than TKN, a 1% licensing fee is charged and sent to the community chest. TKN holders can claim their share of the community chest at any time using Cash & Burn.

The [Community Chest](https://etherscan.io/address/asset-contract.tokencard.eth#analytics) is a smart contract that grows through the proliferation and usage of the card. Every time one of our users top-up his card with any token other than TKN, a 1% licensing fee is charged and sent to the community chest. TKN holders can claim their share of the community chest at any time using Cash & Burn.

Since the TKN community chest is made of the different ERC-20s used in our service, ponderated by their usage, it will eventually become a kind of index backed by the most popular ERC-20 tokens.

As a TKN holder, you are directly incentivised to use and recommend Monolith to your friends. In that sense, TKN is one of the few tokens directly linked to the success of its associated service.

### How can I claim my share of the fees collected in the Community Chest?

TKN holders can redeem their fair share of the community chest through the Cash&Burn function. _At any time_, a TKN holder can use TKN's Cash & Burn function to collect a current pro-rata share of the licensing fees accumulated in the community chest. Their share corresponds to the percentage of TKN burned (relative to the total supply).

Since burning your TKN reduces the total amount of TKN in circulation, it proportionally increases the stake of the community chest which can be claimed by further burning in the future.
