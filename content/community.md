Twitter is our main public communication channel. Follow us here to stay in touch.

Our community hangs out on our Discord/Telegram. Both channels are bridged together. We also have several other channels on our Discord to entertain broader discussions about blockchains.

Finally, you can check /r/Monolith_web3 if you are a Redditor.

Feel free to share your feedback on any channel â€” they help us grow and improve the service.
