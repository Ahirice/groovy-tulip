### Happy May!

We hope you all enjoyed the past month, we did!

We are excited you are enjoying the increase in activity.

Every day is getting busier here at Token HQ.

Token is working hard to finalise our work with The Corner to nail down our new branding. This has been a long process that we are excited to be able to share with you soon!

This month we released the first episode of a series we have called ‘Token Times’ — feel free to let us know your suggestions for a new name, ha!

This was our tester video, now we know how long compliance checks take, and our lighting and sound, we can thrive to improve these factors — and fully intend to!

Enjoy the video below and leave your comments and questions in the comments section on YouTube.

### **Beta Testing**

_“We had an amazing response to our user testing survey and we are working through the respondents in an effort to keep a constant trickle of people coming in as we iterate on the design and the product itself._

_We have received some excellent feedback from the people we had in so far, it is always enlightening to watch real people using our app and seeing what works and areas that don’t work quite as well.”_

\- Anthony Smee, Senior Product Manager
