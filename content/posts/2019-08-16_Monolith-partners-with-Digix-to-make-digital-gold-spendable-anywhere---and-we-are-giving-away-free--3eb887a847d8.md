We are thrilled to announce our partnership with Digix: DGX, the digital gold token will now be spendable anywhere!

To make it happen, we’ve made a couple of additions to the Monolith Wallet:

1.  🔐 DGX and DGD tokens can now be stored on Monolith.
2.  💳 You can now use both DGX and DGD to top-up your Monolith Debit Card.

A gold-backed & Ethereum-enabled financial life is now possible! To celebrate the partnership, Digix is fueling a gold-backed giveaway!

To partake in the distributions, you’ll need a Monolith Debit Card of your own. You can order one [straight from your iPhone](http://monolith.xyz) and have it shipped to all 31 countries of the EEA, which includes most of Europe.

#### Campaign #1 — The shiny Monolith 💳

New user? Activate your Monolith Debit Card to receive DGX worth 0.1g of gold — it’s as simple as that! The DGX activation bonus will be distributed on a first-come-first-served basis to the first 1000 cards that have been activated.

#### Campaign #2 — #SpendGold

📸 Share a photo on Twitter of you spending your DGX on your Monolith Visa Debit Card (or old TokenCard), and receive more DGX worth 0.1g of gold into your wallet.

Make sure to include an image of the card, to use the $DGX ticker and to tag both @Digixglobal and @monolith\_web3 to be eligible. Feel free to include the #SpendGold hashtag too!

This second distribution campaign will be ongoing until Monday, September 09.

The rewards from both campaigns will be deposited straight into your Monolith wallet. Payouts will occur on a daily basis during office hours.

#### Making Gold Spendable

Digix has been making digital gold a reality since March 2018 with the DGX token. Every DGX token represents 1 gram of gold that is stored in accredited precious metals vaults in Singapore and Canada. Retail investors can exchange their DGX token back at Digix to redeem their gold.

Simply put, Digix provides the most convenient and transparent way for retail investors to hold physical investment-grade gold bullion. The integration of Digix with Monolith marks another milestone for both projects. The Monolith Debit Card provides a convenient gateway to spend DGX tokens in 65M+ point of sales worldwide. Thanks to Monolith, the digital gold standard is now even more liquid!
