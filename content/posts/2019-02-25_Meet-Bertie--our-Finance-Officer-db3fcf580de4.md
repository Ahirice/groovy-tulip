Bertie is our in-house finance whizz, and is responsible for all things money at TokenCard. He’s been with the team since 2017 and ensures that everything runs smoothly, from making sure the team gets paid each month 💸 , to forecasting accounts for the road ahead 🔮.

We caught up with Bertie to hear a little more about his TokenCard story.

#### Tell us a little about what you were doing prior to joining TokenCard? What attracted you to the team and the project?

Prior to joining Token I was working for a high net worth insurance claims team… and I was attracted to TokenCard due to the exciting situation of the crypto world at that point. It was just beginning to take off and it is a frontier of technology development.

#### OK, give us a snapshot of what your day-to-day looks like?

My day to day responsibilities involve a mixture of activities. I have my usual tasks of dealing with invoices, reconciliations and maintaining the company books. However, I also handle larger tasks such as creating and maintaining the reconciliation on the company Crypto assets and forecasting models.

#### How does managing accounts for a blockchain startup differ from a “traditional” company?

In regard to the Fiat side I’d say it is quite similar. It is the crypto side which is new and thus far has no well trodden path set out. Therefore we have had to develop our own process in-house for reconciling, recording and calculating things such as capital gains until HMRC sets out rules. The UX around crypto vs. traditional banking experience also throws up issues, e.g. unlike a bank account, there is generally no transaction detail added to the blockchain transaction, which has knock-on effects when it comes to reconciliation.

#### You’ve been working in this space for a couple of years now — what’s your advice for anyone looking to get into blockchain?

It’s definitely about thoroughly researching the technology and the projects out there… I would also recommend purchasing some crypto just to see the process and how it works (if you don’t know already) — it will be good practice.

#### Why should folks consider TokenCard as a home for their talents?

Because it’s a fast growing, disruptive, technology and industry, and everyone in the company is genuinely passionate about it. It’s great being around this level of energy which is so evident when you speak to Mel, the CEO — his enthusiasm for what’s being built and the vision is infectious.

In addition, everyone from Engineering to Ops are all actively interested in the space and care about what they are building. If anyone wants to work with great, super smart people, if they want to be challenged by complexity and build something that could have a major disruptive impact for the good, then this is definitely the place to be.

#### Around the team, you have a reputation for being ‘Mr. Gym’ 💪 What workout would you invent that combines work and fitness?

Erm… some form of bench rack desk to do sets on when thinking over how I am going to approach a task (_we’re not quite sure if that one will catch on in the office, but we’ll keep you all posted_)…

Thanks Bertie! If you’d like to join him and the rest of the team at TokenCard, take a look at our [**open roles on Workable**](https://tokencard.workable.com) and introduce yourself 👋
