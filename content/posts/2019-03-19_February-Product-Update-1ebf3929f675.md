February has been about one thing — getting us ready to get the the TokenCard alpha cards into our community’s hands. Here’s the progress we’ve made on the Product and Engineering front.

If you check out our product timeline **@** [**ProductPlan**](https://app.productplan.com/p/WKmCZlrSDYGGdjB9HtBUJZKA9Cl6PCXD), here’s what’s new:

1\. **Moved to Mainnet**

2\. **TokenCard green cards have landed**

3\. **Contract Wallet audits**

4\. **On the road @ EthCC**

#### Moved to Mainnet

When watching our ‘_testing diary_’ videos over the past week or so, the eagle eyed of you will have noticed a little green dot 🔘 in the app with _“Mainnet_” next to it. Last month we moved our tests from the Ropsten Testnet to Ethereum Mainnet.

This is a significant effort from the Product and Engineering team, and puts in a position where we can really kick the tyres on the Contract Wallet and the TokenCard card — handling conversions from ETH to fiat in a live environment, and spending real rather than test ETH.

#### **TokenCard green cards: staff testing**

This month we were excited to announce that the first TokenCard alpha green cards landed in the office. This has been off the back of a huge amount of work across the team — through Product and Engineering, Design, Operations, and Marketing.

We’ve been doing extensive testing on the card and applying tweaks and fixes as we go to ensure it’s safe and secure before we send it out externally. We’ll put together a short blog in the coming weeks to run you through the types of tests we’ve been doing, and some tips for how you can get involved too.

We’re excited to open the doors of the TokenCard alpha to our community. Keep your eyes peeled on your inbox and [**@tokencard\_io**](https://twitter.com/tokencard_io) for updates.

#### Contract Wallet audits

As we pick up the pace on the road to launching the TokenCard to the world, our Product and Engineering team have spent much of their time BUIDL’ing and QA’ing the various pieces of the Token platform— the wallet, the card, and the app.

February saw the Engineering team send the Contract Wallet code for a further round of reviews with external auditors — tweaks and edits aside, this will put us on the home stretch for releasing it to the wider world.

#### **On the road at EthCC**

Mel, Mischa, and Yannis from Team Token rounded off the month with a trip to EthCC, the international Ethereum community conference and meet-up held in Paris 🇫🇷 These events are always a great opportunity to meet those making a real difference to the Ethereum ecosystem, plus it allows us to do some on-the-road testing with the TokenCard alpha cards.

Thanks — Team Token
