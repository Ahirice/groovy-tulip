Daniel is our Head of Design, and is responsible for the look and feel of all things TokenCard — from the visual identity of the brand, to everything you interact with in the app!

Daniel started life at Token as an engaged Community member before joining the team — we caught up with him to get a little insight into his Token adventure so far…

#### Hi Daniel 👋 Tell us a little about what you do.

I work mainly on the User Experience (UX) / User Interface (UI) side. This includes user and competitor research, ideation, creating user stories, flows and journeys, producing low/high fidelity prototypes, user interviewing, usability testing… The list goes on!

#### What attracted you to TokenCard?

The [**White Paper**](https://tokencard.io/tokencard_whitepaper.pdf), the buzzing community, passionate Co-Founders and the chance to work on something truly ground-breaking that disrupts the _status quo_ of our traditional banking systems.

#### Give us a snapshot of what your average day at TokenCard involves

This is gonna sound super boring but — to be honest — a typical day is just getting s\*\*t done. Being in a fast-paced startup, the list of things that needs doing is endless, so it’s about working your way through it.

#### **What is the most challenging part of designing for both the world of finance _and_ blockchain?**

The most challenging part is remembering to design for people that are completely new to the blockchain space — not catering only for the “crypto geeks”. It’s our duty to educate them about the technology and how to keep their funds secure in an understandable, digestible manner.

Designing for the blockchain requires _patience_. Patience in understanding insanely smart, superhuman developers and translating their vision into something that can be used by normal humans — _us_. It requires thinking outside the box and taking different design approaches to what you’re used to.

It’s a different game with different rules and, as this industry is still young, the landscape changes constantly with new rules being introduced. Simply said, there’s _a lot_ to take in.

#### **What, or who, inspires you from a design or UX point of view?**

Massimo Vignelli, Don Norman, the Dalai Lama, Dan Petty and Pablo Stanley all inspire me. However, I probably draw most of my inspiration from _travelling_. Talking with people from all walks of life, learning about different cultures and having new experiences — this all helps to design for humans.

#### **What do you value most in a professional context?**

Working with a team of good, down to earth people that are there to help, support, learn from, and grow with is what I value most. That along with, working hard, playing harder. Celebrating achievements and milestones is also very important to me.

#### **Without looking, what are your favourite apps — from a design perspective — on your phone?**

I would have to say Spotify, Uber, and Whatsapp.

Not necessarily from a visual design standpoint but from a UX perspective — these apps allow me to accomplish goals seamlessly.

#### **Ok, so it’s got to be asked; if you could have any superpower, what would it be?**

I’d say teleportation, like Dr Strange, Nightcrawler or my guy from Jumper (_for those of us less familiar with the 2008 classic,_ [_this one_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489099/)). Imagine that, with a click of the finger you could be anywhere you desire… You could do lunch breaks at a game reserve in Kenya… Chill with the giraffes… How cool..?!
