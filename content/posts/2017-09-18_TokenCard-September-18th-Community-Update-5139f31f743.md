Greetings from TokenCard HQ in London. We would like to start by saying thanks to the community for their continued support. tknfan, a community member, visited us a couple of weeks ago for what was a great interaction and we remain excited about meeting others from the community soon.

We had a few notable mentions this week with our founders Mel and David being featured in the list of leading ‘techtrepreneurs’ in the UK on [Mashable](http://mashable.com/2017/09/15/uk-techtrepreneurs-empire/#ts.UYjb_LiqZ). Mel provided his expert comments on [tokenized USD](http://www.the-blockchain.com/2017/09/13/tether-ethfinex-enable-tokenized-usd-ethereum-network/) being launched on the Ethereum Blockchain.

We remain on track for the MVP release planned for the end of the year. There is still much to be done before then, and we are continually looking for top talent from around London. You may have noticed that we have recently updated our existing website to fix some minor issues, however, a major rework of tokencard.io is currently underway and will be released in the coming weeks.

There have been developments in China that have influenced the cryptocurrency industry in general. Despite these developments, we continue to work to forge partnerships in the region. William, our director of partnerships, was touring the east-coast of China last week, meeting with potential partners and giving presentations on TokenCard.

### AMA & Oct. 2nd Meetup

We’ve had many requests for more community engagement. We’ve kept our regular updates concise, however, there remain a lot of unanswered questions from the community. To help answer some of these questions, we’ll be hosting an AMA scheduled for the 25th of September 2017 on [reddit](http://reddit.com/r/tokencard). If successful, we hope to turn this into a more regular point of contact with you guys.

We’re approaching our meetup date of 2nd October 2017 and have been busy planning the event. [**The tickets go live at midnight**](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/tokencard-community-event-tickets-37943575255). We really do look forward to meeting our community in London so please register before tickets run out!
