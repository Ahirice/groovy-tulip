Hello Tokenauts,

Last Monday, we proudly opened up the sign-up for the first 1,000 TokenCard Visa Debit alpha cards!

This a significant step for us that was made possible by your support, so thank you from all the team. You had lots of questions so we’ve put together this post to try and answer some of the most popular ones.

### Onboarding

#### Who is eligible?

We opened up the sign-up first to our Crowdsale contributors. If you didn’t participate in the ICO, you can still register your interest for the [TokenCard Visa Debit alpha cards here](https://tokencard.io/alpha/). This will mean you’re first in line for when we open it up to everyone.

The TokenCard app is currently only available for iOS: you need to have access to an iOS-powered device to be able to take part in the alpha.

ℹ️ _Please note: the alpha phase is limited to the UK and EEA countries. If you live in another geography, you can still register your interest to get notified as soon as the TokenCard Visa Debit cards are available in your region._

You’ll have to complete a KYC procedure before registering interest for a card.

#### When is the Android app coming?

We’ve started with iOS for the MVP to narrow the scope and because of its secure enclave used in the Contract Wallet. We’re as keen as you are to bring TokenCard to Android (both our founders are Android users!).

#### Why do I need to provide personal information?

When applying for a card, we ask you for personal information to communicate with you and so that we can meet our Know Your Customer (KYC) obligations. We must do this before issuing a card.

#### When will I get my card?

Our cards are sent out from the UK in regular mail so delivery times will vary depending on the address. The majority of eligible cardholders will receive their card within ten days of applying. It could take slightly longer for customers living somewhat further afield.

#### Can I choose the card base currency?

Currently, all the cards are using the Pound (£). However we are working on adding Euro € cards and letting you choose your base currency. We're currently running the last batches of tests for this feature, stay tuned!

#### What does “activate card” mean?

For security purposes, your card needs to be activated before you can use it. It means that if your card is intercepted on its way to you, the card will not work. When you have received your card, you must tap activate for the card to work.

If you accidentally activate the card before you have received it, simply tap Freeze card in the Card section of the app to temporarily deactivated it. You can reactivate the card by taping "Unfreeze Card" in the card section of the app once you receive the card.

#### How can I get my card pin?

After you have received your card, you should activate your card. Go to the Card section of the Token app and select View My Pin, ensuring you are in a private place and no one else can see your pin.

#### What is “verified by VISA”?

Once your card is activated, you can enable the “Verified by VISA” feature. It enforces an additional validation layer on online payments to protect your card. You will choose a password that will be required to confirm any online purchase.

ℹ️ _Please note: Once activated, you will have to fill in randomized specific characters of your password to validate an online payment, for instance characters n° 4, 7 & 10._

### Using the card

#### What tokens can I use for spending on my TokenCard card?

During the alpha phase, you can use ETH, TKN and DAI tokens to settle card transactions. It means ETH/TKN/DAI will be debited from your wallet and converted by us into fiat to settle transactions you make on your card. Keep up to date with our progress on the community section in our website to get details on subsequent releases and support for additional tokens.

#### What are the fees associated with TokenCard Visa Debit Card?

#### How do I change my card pin?

You can change your card pin by visiting any ATM near you that accepts Visa cards and using the ATM change pin feature.

#### I’ve lost my card, what should I do?

In the Card section of the Token app, you can select Report Lost or Stolen to cancel your card and order a replacement instantly. If you do not have access to the TokenCard app, then please open a ticket on [TokenCard Help Centre](https://support.tokencard.io/hc/en-us).

#### 📳 Alpha testers: Shake it like you mean it!

We’re keen to make TokenCard as great as possible, and we need your help to do it. Once you’ve joined the alpha **you can quickly and conveniently report any bug you come across just by shaking your iPhone**. It automatically provides us with all the data we need to troubleshoot.

It is the most efficient and straightforward way for you to report a bug, so please, shake it like you mean it! You can also join our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/RhxpjpX) to discuss the alpha with the team and the other testers.

#### 🙋 I still have some questions

If we’ve missed anything, please check out the [TokenCard Help Centre](https://support.tokencard.io/hc/en-us) which covers the app, the card, the token and other frequently asked questions.

Thanks for being among the pioneers of the non-custodial consumer finance movement! We can’t wait to build on the TokenCard alpha with all your feedback and help.
