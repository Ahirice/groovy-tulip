So it’s been a rough few days trying to get TKN ready and sorted after a server-side [bug](http://vessenes.com/tokencard-tech-roundup-and-erc20-crediting/) amused some trouble in the original deployment.

We’ve been working with a skilled third party auditing team. The [plan](http://vessenes.com/tkn-updates-day-2/) was to independently come to the same total TKN amount issued, cross-reference, and then deploy.
