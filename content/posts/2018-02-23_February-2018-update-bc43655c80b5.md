David and I catching a breath at the end of another long week. Things are well.

Hello everybody, welcome to our monthly newsletter and happy February! We are one or two days later than normal but we have our reasons… from here on out we’re expanding our newsletter by also giving our take on what’s going on in the world of crypto.

#### New entrants

This week we are turning our attention to Robinhood, the mobile micro investing platform who recently announced that they are taking a plunge into the world of crypto. They join the likes of Revolut, Plus500, eToro and Trading212, all of whom have sought to get in on this latest wave of mania.

Their entrance into the space comes at no real surprise, some of the more successful traditional fintech startups (such as Revolut and Robinhood) have for grown their businesses rapidly — with them now at around one and two million users respectively, it makes sense for them to try and capture the exponential interest in crypto. The question remains whether or not they can strike the right chord within the industry.

All in all, these numbers are dwarfed by the top crypto companies. Coinbase is smashing it with upwards of 13 million users, and most of the top-10 exchanges are exceeding 1 million active users _per day_. From our perspective, people around the world are way more excited in participating in this new and thriving token economy as opposed to merely being satisfied by the old world, no matter how nice a make-over it is getting.

It is one thing for a successful, traditional fintech to try and force their way into the world of crypto solely due to their own momentum, but we all know that the key to success in this space to build things on top of the fundamentals (which we believe to be) — decentralisation, smart contracts and synergy within the ecosystem.

Where we see these institutions going wrong, is in their implementation. We all know that buying ETH on Robinhood doesn’t actually buy you ETH, it is no more than a price-tracking proxy. You can’t deposit or withdraw any real crypto, which in our minds falls short. Whether or not the main reason for this is compliance-related, customers won’t care, what they will care about is the advent of properly-engineered decentralised systems delivering value on Ethereum.

#### Building from the ground-up

More and more traditional fintechs are going to start flirting with the space. They’ll bring with them propositions with simple onboarding and user-friendly UX — things that everyone will learn from and no doubt build into their own offerings.

However, the true kings of the hill will be the home-bred Ethereum companies — who will initially match but ultimately surpass the best customer experiences found in other markets — whilst staying true to the core principles underlying the industry.

We at Token are staying true to the vision and we are building the most ambitious products in the space.

### Token: powering ahead

There’s nothing more important than people. We are laser focused on building the right team. Token’s success is coupled with our ability to attract the highest calibre of talent and we are spending most of our time meeting people, selecting only the best.

Having already hired Mischa — our inspiring CTO — his priority is to now assemble a world-class engineering team. Hiring is a non-stop endeavour, but thankfully London attracts some of the world’s most talented people. What we are finding is that everyone we meet is fully bought-in to what we’re trying to do, we just have to make sure we are focused on building the right team. There will be many new additions to the team in the coming weeks as we continue to scale.

#### The science of compliance

In order to maximise our potential we need to combine great people and technology with the right relationships with the regulatory bodies. Our Compliance Officer, Ben, is all over this, and we have some major opportunities ahead as we square up to future market regulation. Ben is building on existing strong relationships with the regulators to set the agenda and position us as a model, first-mover organisation. For those of you that haven’t experienced compliance management in action first hand, it’s a relatively easy discipline to dismiss — we’re clear though that it will make a real difference…to both us as a business, and to our customers.

There are some very clear wins in this field, from offering our customers enhanced protection (something very much needed in the space), to being perceived in the best light by potential industry partners (which opens up new opportunities others won’t be able to access). A bank or issuer is much more likely to want to engage you if you have clear and stringent policies on the various compliance disciplines. We have high goals within UK compliance, and intend to lead the effort to normalise crypto as a mainstream marketplace.

#### Development on multiple fronts

On the development side, we’ve been busy building out our integration with our issuer, conducting some final Smart Contract audits for our initial product release. We have also been investing in automation surrounding our cloud infrastructure, this will allow us to scale elastically in the cloud whilst maximising redundancy to minimise failover time.

We have selected a new KYC partner that will be able to handle global processing, and a new crypto AML partner that can perform real-time analysis of our card operations.

We’ve also been taking a fresh look at the overall customer onboarding process — looking to get the balance right between what appears ‘technically-proficient’, and what is more fun and engaging.

We want to have the best onboarding experience the industry has seen. Onboarding is a key element in determining success and will not be underestimated by us. We know that it can be the difference between an app that gets abandoned soon after downloading, or a key element of what becomes a runaway success. We have some great ideas and possibilities unique to our platform that we plan to fully exploit. Stay tuned on this.

#### Clear routes to market

Given how much time and effort we have been investing in hiring the right term to make this a success, we have decided to put some effort into creating a number of short videos introducing members of the team, their passions and motivations. In an attempt to highlight the depth of experience and knowledge we have brought to Token, as of next month a section of this newsletter will be written by one of the members of the team, so you can get a glimpse into what makes everyone here at Token awesome.

In the meantime, why not book to come and see us at Money 20/20 in Amsterdam? It’s between 4–6 June, and we’ll have a big presence there. It’s a great event (styling itself as ‘where the future of money is invented’), we can’t wait to be there and we’d love to see you there too!

The only guarantee after a busy February is an even-busier March — stay in touch as Token truly takes shape.

Much love,

The Token team.
