### ðŸš€ Weâ€™re rolling out App TestingÂ ðŸš€

Weâ€™re super excited to have new Tokenauts testing our app. Wave 2 rollout began this week with another 80 of you playing with our app and giving us tons of great feedback. A big shout out to our Supreme Tokenaut Bankers who are distributing our play coins for testing and doing an awesome job helping out the newbies.

Want to find out more? Check out the new channel in the Discord server for the App testers to see what our Tester Tokenauts are making of itâ€Šâ€”â€Šthis is where they are sharing their QR codes, comments and memes.Â

Stay tuned as weâ€™ll have an update on Wave 3 testing very soon. Weâ€™re keen to get as many of you involved as possibleâ€Šâ€”â€Šyour feedback is vital to our success ðŸ¤“

Weâ€™re also doing our own internal security tests at the moment. Our initial penetration testing went well, and weâ€™ll be heading into another round of testing soon. Security testing will be carried out all throughout our lifespan, so we can stay on top of having the best security possible.
