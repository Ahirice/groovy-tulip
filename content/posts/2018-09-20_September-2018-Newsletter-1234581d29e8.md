It’s September already? Time is flying. It’s a busy month ahead at Token, featuring early access to the TokenApp for our Community, new joiners to the team, a very special trip to Hong Kong, and more.

### **Become a Token Alpha Tester**

Get exclusive early access to the TokenApp on iOS! It’s as easy as clicking the link below and registering your interest in becoming a tester. We’ll do the rest.

[Join the Token Alpha](https://ventures.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=a08825d6fe73df28f11896631&id=a723cba819&MERGE0=%3C%3C%20Test%20Email%20Address%20%3E%3E "Join the Token Alpha")

While you’re here, join our [Community Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/WKRmkT4) to get the latest news from the team, as well as the opportunity to chat with fellow Tokenauts.

### TokenTeam Update

The team is growing! We’re moving into a brand new office this week (as you’re reading this) and will be sharing pictures of the new Token HQ on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tokencard_io) — follow us for updates there. Speaking of growth, meet the new faces at Token:

**Ed Asseily, Chief Operating Officer**   
Ed joins us as COO this month. Having previously worked in the banking market in both Asia and Europe with CitiBank and Standard Chartered, as well as developing his own startup, AI Collect, we could not be happier to have such an accomplished addition to the team.

**Ramesh Nair, Full Stack Developer**  
Ramesh joins the the front end team to build the best app experience possible for our community. Before Token, Ramesh worked at Morgan Stanley and IBM, and brings a wealth of experience with him.

**Krishna Kotecha, iOS Developer**  
Testing the Token Alpha on iOS ([get started here](https://ventures.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=a08825d6fe73df28f11896631&id=a723cba819&MERGE0=%3C%3C%20Test%20Email%20Address%20%3E%3E))? Then you’ll be seeing a lot of Krishna’s work! Having developed iOS apps since the first iPhone’s release, he was one of the first engineers at Hailo, and has developed apps for TopShop, Babylon Health, and Wordeo.

…and a special to mention to **Daniel Smith**, our Head of Design, who celebrated his one year Token anniversary in August. Daniel started off as a Community member before joining full time. Want to join him and the Team? [Click here to see our open roles](https://tokencard.workable.com/).

### Hong Kong FinTech Week

We’ve been chosen by the UK Department of International Trade to take part in a mission to Hong Kong, where we’ll be part of a showcase of the UK’s leading FinTechs. Our very own Will is heading out there; if you see him, do say “Hi”.

### TokenTraining

Every Wednesday, one of the Team presents on a topic of their choice to the wider Team at Token HQ. This week, Ed presented on Risk Management. We’ll be sharing future talks with the Community! Here’s Ed in action.

### In Case You Missed It!

We published our **Participation Principles** for the Community this month. We hope this document helps sheds some light on how we manage expectations, as well as being a go-to on what we stand for as a community.

Last month, I (DanQ) posted my personal view on the **‘State of the Community’**, and my goals for where I want the community to get to.
