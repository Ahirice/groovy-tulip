#### Contribution Event

We want to extend out thanks to all those that contributed in the TKN Creation Event. We raised a staggering 12.5mm in ETH and 3mm in other tokens, all in the span of minutes.

We are now exactly one week on and, _having squashed some nasty_ [_bugs_](http://vessenes.com/tokencard-tech-roundup-and-erc20-crediting/), want to update you on our plans looking forward.

#### Support

We really want to thank all those that have helped us along the way; from people spreading the word to brilliant projects coming out in our support. The solidarity and inter-project support in the space is heart-warming. This “Ethereum Economy” that we’re all building together is a special and fascinating place, and I hope the current sentiments and atmosphere persists far into the future as we grow to create a new economy for the _coming age_.

We’re very exited to be part of the big picture and are more confident than ever TokenCard will play a critical part to expedite us towards this common goal.

#### Contributed, but didn’t get TKN?

If you sent a contribution in tokens (like DGD) after 27 minutes you won’t have received any TKN. The TKN contract had finished crediting TKN at that point.

Check this list if you want to know if you fall in this group:

> The “too late to the party”  [**refund list**](https://gist.github.com/vessenes/8d784cc28f738d98d707cb3a58ff7a1f).

We’d love to credit TKN for your contribution but unfortunately our Contribution Terms bar us from doing so. **Tokens are currently being returned to you. They will be sent back to the address they were sent from.**

Other: some people have sent from an exchange. You will need to talk to the exchange about that.

_Want to get your hands on TKN regardless!? You can trade them on an exchange:_

Wauw!

#### Exchanges

TKN is currently traded on several exchanges:

*   [**Bittrex**](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-TKN)  (Officially Supported)
*   [**EtherDelta**](https://etherdelta.github.io/#TKN-ETH)  (Decentralized Exchange)
*   [**CryptoDerrivatives**](https://cryptoderivatives.market/token/TKN)  (Decentralized Exchange)
*   [**Liqui**](https://liqui.io/#/exchange/TKN_ETH)

#### 500 MVP cards

We will compile a list of the top 500 contributors who are eligible for the MVP cards over the next few days. More details soon.

#### Communication

The main communication channel will be on [Slack](https://tokencard-team.herokuapp.com/) and of course right here on Medium. Periodic newsletters will go out to our 4000 (and counting) subscribers.

[Jake Vartanian](https://twitter.com/jakevartanian) and [Dwight Sproull](https://twitter.com/dwightsproull) are our community managers and can be found on our [Slack:](https://tokencard-team.herokuapp.com/) “@jake” and “@dwight”. Chase them with your thoughtful, yet repetitive, questions!

_I myself will allocate half an hour every morning and every evening to answer questions, mainly publicly on Slack “@mel”. I know everyone wants time to get their questions answered by me, but I think it is most appropriate for me to stay entirely focussed on the product and make sure that moves ahead at full speed._

#### Payment networks

Recently some mainstream articles have suggested direct relations between us and payment networks. Projects like ours operate through an authorised issuing bank. Articles suggesting otherwise are incorrect.

To mitigate this problem, and at the advice of the issuing bank, I have ordered to remove all explicit mentions of Network brands to ensure no further confusion happens. The product has not materially changed in any way; TokenCard will still be branded with the various respective Networks.

#### **The months ahead**

We are heads down focussed on the product. Looking at our timeline, there is a chance we might be able to ship the MVP TokenCards before our mid September goal. _Fingers crossed_. Progress updates will be posted here every two weeks, or whenever appropriate.

#### Hiring

We will be hiring from the community over the next few weeks; more detailed job listings will follow. However, if you are a brilliant Solidity developer bursting to help us change the world please reach out to us _right now_ at david@monolith.ventures :)
