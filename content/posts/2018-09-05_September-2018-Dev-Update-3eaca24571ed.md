Hello, it’s Mischa :)

I thought I would start giving everyone updates on what the Product and Engineering team have been up to here at Token. We have been working on a number of things including analytics, security, compliance, smart contract development, through to UX enhancements to interactions around the Gas Tank in the TokenWallet.

Security and the safety our of users’ funds is central to the success of our project. We have recently employed a mobile contractor to help solidify our mobile app following up from the initial penetration test. We are looking to kick off the next round of penetration testing this month.

In order to interact with the old world, we need to meet the requirements of the traditional institutions, they have standards developed over many years for very good reasons. As a privacy nut, I am making sure that we are committed to doing the right thing by our users. We are proactively looking at self-certifying against the PCI compliance framework, so that when we onboarded with our card issuer, we already have one big task ticked off the list.

I am also working on building the most user friendly terms of service and privacy policy possible, our users are not the product and we will ensure that we have a great working relationship with everyone who users our platform.

Being in the FCA Sandbox, we’ve committed to undertaking certain regulatory activities, a notable one being Client Due Diligence (CDD) which must be completed by all TokenCard applicants. We are working with technologies that we think will fit best our goal of minimising money laundry and make for the best user experience in the TokenApp.

We are working hard on setting up an Oracle on the blockchain making the way that we calculate the exchange rates needed to power our security features completely transparent to you blockchain geeks. This allows everyone the ability to verify exchange rates themselves.

In the TokenApp, we are working on improvements to the recovery flow and also ensuring that the card sign up process is flawless ready for when it goes live. Also, upon feedback we are working on improving the ‘Gas’ mechanic to make it more user friendly.

The team has been investing some time and effort into building our own Smart Contract Code Coverage checking tool. When looking to test our Smart Contract we found bugs in all for the existing tools and decided that it was a good plan to build this internally for ourselves. We will be looking to open-source this tool for wider Ethereum Community when we get the time to tidy up the documentation. Finally the team have also invested heavily into analytics and automated testing of our mobile app.

Cheers!

Mischa
