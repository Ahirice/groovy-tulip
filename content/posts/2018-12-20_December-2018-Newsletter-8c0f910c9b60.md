It’s December! The festive season is here, and it’s the final Token newsletter of 2018. Before we dive in, we’d like to take a moment to thank you for your support this year. Our Community is a huge part of what we’re building, and _you’re_ a big part of it. Wherever you are, we hope you have a restful and enjoyable holiday season.

So, without further ado, here’s how we’ve been rounding off the year.

### Growing the TokenAlpha

If you’ve been following our Alpha, you will have seen that we had previously capped it at 300 Community users during testing. Now, we’re excited to announce that we’re opening up the Alpha to even more Tokenauts, as we move from our own internal testing environment to Ropsten testnet!

_Why is this big news_? Being live on Ropsten is super important for us — it resembles Ethereum more closely than our own internal network, so testing on Ropsten will allow us to really put the TokenWallet through its paces.

### The Coffee’s on Crypto

As we move toward testing and releasing the first wave of TokenCards, we’ve been getting a lot of questions from our Community around how the card and the wallet will work. So we’ve taken some time out to answer them.

Our COO Ed took a look under the hood of the TokenCard, shedding some light on the mechanics of topping up and spending. [**You can read this month’s post here →**](https://medium.com/tokencard/the-coffees-on-crypto-%EF%B8%8F-a-deep-dive-into-how-your-tokencard-will-work-71fe81845b6f)

We’re building TokenCard so that it feels familiar day-to-day spending in all the important ways, whilst at the same time being a genuinely revolutionary experience. Today, that looks like a crypto-to-fiat top-up and a payment card like you know and love. Tomorrow, it is our aim to enable instant crypto auth, for an even smoother user experience when spending.

### Order up!

Last week, the Token Team (in our finest Christmas knitwear) got together for an internal review of the TokenCard order flow. This was the first opportunity to see the whole flow in action, and was super exciting up close!

As the order flow is one of the first points of contact for TokenCard users, we’re building with a firm eye on making it secure and robust, without losing out on usability. Our CEO Mel was the first to give it a go.

### What we built last month

So we’ve made great progress this month on Community testing and piecing together the TokenCard order process. Our Product and Engineering team have also made huge strides across the board. Here’s what we go up to:

**Smart Contract audits**. Last month we provided an update on sending our Smart Contract to two external auditors for review. We were super happy with the feedback, and have already addressed the edge cases that were raised.

**TokenApp 1.6 and 1.7**. We’ve been picking up the pace as we approach the festive period, and have released a couple of updates to the TokenApp Alpha this month already! The big changes that you’ll notice are to “**Gas**” (making it a bit more intuitive for our users), the “**Backup Seed**” (used for recovering wallets), and some UI updates to make the app look and feel smoother.

### The festive season at Token

’Tis the season 🎄 This month has also been about getting into the festive spirit. We had the second ever Token Christmas get together at the beginning of December, featuring demos from around the team and some great Christmas jumpers. Mel wins an award for his “Jurassic Card” DIY job…

As it’s the season of giving, we’ve also been updating our Twitter feed with “**12 Days of Token**”. Everyday, from Monday 10th of December to Friday 21st December, we’re posting a special update, image, or announcement. Stay tuned [@**tokencard\_io**](https://twitter.com/tokencard_io).

That’s all for now, folks. Happy holidays, and thank you — see you in 2019!
