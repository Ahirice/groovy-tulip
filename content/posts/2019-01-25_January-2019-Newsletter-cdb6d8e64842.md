Hi Tokenauts 👋 It’s our first newsletter of the year, and we have some exciting developments on the card, our smart contract bug bounty, and more!

### Staff TokenCard Testing

For our first round of card testing, over the next few weeks we’ll be running various scenario tests within the team so that we have the best chance of ensuring that the card is fit and firing. For this round of tests, we’ll be using Ropsten test ETH and real fiat while we work on the big move to mainnet.

Just a few of the things we’re testing at this stage include:

*   **Does the card work as expected (Contactless, ATM, Chip, etc.)?**
*   **Are our fraud systems picking up “bad” uses of the card?**
*   **Do the wallet and card communicate properly to one another?**
*   **Does the card work both at home and abroad?**
*   **Will the card work on the London Underground?**
*   **How does the card handle deposits e.g. hotels and rentals?**
*   **If we block the card, does it _actually_ stay blocked?**

Once we’ve wrapped up this round of testing, the next step is the Community release, where we’ll be sending out unbranded Alpha cards (fortunately they’ll still be **green**)! We’ll be posting an update on our blog with more details on who we’ll be shipping to, and where — for now, here’s a first look at how TokenCards will be arriving at your door for the first 1,000 cards.

### Building out our Bug Bounty

Last month, we went live on Ropsten, for the first time giving our Alpha testers the ability to interact with their wallet using tools such as Etherscan and Metamask, as well as giving us the opportunity to put the TokenWallet through its paces in a live environment.

So what’s next? Before moving to mainnet, we’ll be launching our Bug Bounty. This will begin with our Smart Contract before expanding out to more of our codebase. Mischa will put out another blog post once the bounty is live, including details on the bounty pool and how we’ll be supporting our developer community throughout the process. Stay tuned!

For now, [**check out Mischa’s Gist**](https://gist.github.com/mischat/ca899c58bca9b89b7a9969c56a7b7b01) for details on the Smart Contract →

### Token Team Update

Token HQ is filling up with new faces as we continue to grow the team! This month we’re super excited to welcome two new arrivals:

**Amadeo, Product Manager ➡️** Amadeo joins the Product team to help take our app and backend services to the next level. An early crypto BUILD’er, he co-founded Coinfloor, the UK’s leading cryptocurrency exchange and subsequently Warden, a cybersecurity startup.

**James, Backend Engineer ➡️** James’ goal is to move fast and **_not_** break things, focussing on maturity and stability. Before TokenCard, James worked around the London Fintech scene, including companies such as GoCardless and Cuvva, and brings with him his experience of disrupting legacy industries with technology.
