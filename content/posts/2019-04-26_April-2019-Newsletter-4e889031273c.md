Here’s what’s on the menu for April — opening up the TokenCard alpha further, adding € to our card, TKN on Ethfinex, and an introduction to the latest addition to Team Token: Brice, our new community manager ⬇️

#### TokenCard Alpha Access, Now Open to All

Last Monday, we proudly opened up the sign-up for the first TokenCard Visa® Debit cards to Crowdsale contributors. We’re thrilled to announce that we’re going one step further from this week; steadily granting access to all those who registered interest for the TokenCard alpha at [**tokencard.io/alpha**](https://tokencard.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a08825d6fe73df28f11896631&id=b16d276046&e=c804d3727c).

Thank you to all those already using the card for their feedback and support. For everyone else, don’t miss out — sign up on our website and claim your spot!

#### TokenCard Euro Cards

The good news doesn’t stop with the alpha launch! We’re glad to announce support for Euro (€) as a base currency for your TokenCard, available to select in the app. You’re now able to pick your preferred currency (EUR € / GBP £) during the card order process.

Thought it couldn’t get any better? Wait for this:

As we charge zero fees for domestic Point of Sale purchases (that is, when you use your card in a shop) it means that there is no POS fee for any EU citizen (with a € card) across Europe: 1 card, 19 countries, 0 (PoS) fees.

#### TKN Live on Ethfinex Trustless

You voted, Ethfinex listened. Following their latest Twitter poll, trading for TKN has been enabled on Ethfinex Trustless! Start trading at [**trustless.ethfinex**](https://tokencard.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a08825d6fe73df28f11896631&id=9ce2a6b975&e=c804d3727c).

We are aware that exchanges and liquidity are topics that our community frequently ask about. Rest assured, we’re working on it.

#### Introducing Brice, Community Manager

Brice is our new Community Manager, joining the TokenCard team to manage the community discussion and increase our presence both within the crypto community and outside of it. Fashionably late to the party (the ICO flew under his radar), but once he discovered the project, he was thrilled of finally having a way to achieve his goal: live his life on Ether.

We caught up with Brice to hear a more about his journey. [**Read more here on our blog →**](https://medium.com/tokencard/meet-brice-our-community-manager-87fdb2c6bcce)

We’re super excited to see the first cards arrive through our community members’ doors. And we want to see it when it happens! Share your unboxing with us on Twitter [**@tokencard\_io**](https://tokencard.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a08825d6fe73df28f11896631&id=fb346bc618&e=c804d3727c) (don’t forget to cover your card number).

Welcome to the **#TokenCard1K.**

See you next month — Team Monolith
