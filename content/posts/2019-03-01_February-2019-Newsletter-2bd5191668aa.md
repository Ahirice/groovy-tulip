Hi Tokenauts, welcome to February’s newsletter! It’s been a busy month: we’ve made a lot of progress with the TokenCard card, and we’re happy to announce details for our community meet-up next month. Let’s dive in…

#### Unveiling the TokenCard alpha

It’s been a long time coming, and today we’re happy to reveal the first images of the TokenCard Visa Debit card for our alpha testing period! **Welcome to self-sovereign finance**.

The team are testing the alpha TokenCard cards right now, putting it through its paces ahead of the wider rollout. In terms of the alpha rollout, we’ll be sending out the 1,000 cards in small batches — _starting in March_ — in order to give us a good amount of time for testing. This will start with ICO holders before moving to our community in the UK and EEA, on a country-by-country basis.

We’re itching to get TokenCard to our community as soon as possible, bringing the Ethereum economy to the palm of your hand. Over the next week or so, we’ll show you the card in action for the very first time. We’ll also share more info on what TKN will look like during the TokenCard alpha! Stay tuned.

#### TokenCard Community Meet-up

You’ve been with us on this journey since the beginning, and as we approach the lift-off of TokenCard, we want you to celebrate with us. What better way to do so than with a community meet-up?!

Last week we put the date for our meet-up to a community vote — thank you to everyone who voted and shared! We’re happy to reveal that the details for the meet-up are (_drum roll, please_):

📅 **Thursday, 21st of March**

📍 [**TT Liquor, London**](https://goo.gl/maps/kD3y2AT69XM2)

⏰ **6:30PM — 10PM (**GMT**)**

We’ll announce more details on the itinerary for the evening, so you know what to expect. Keep an eye out here on our blog 👀

#### Meet Bertie, our Finance Officer

Over the next few months, we’re making it our aim to introduce you — _our community_ — to the team at TokenCard. After all, we interact with you everyday in some form, and it’s great to put a face to a name.

First up, meet Bertie, our Finance Officer. He’s been with the team since 2017 and ensures that everything runs smoothly, from making sure the team gets paid each month, to forecasting accounts for the road ahead.

Earlier this month, we [**revealed our designs for the TokenCard**](https://twitter.com/tokencard_io/status/1093441738469978113) for when we ship to the wider world after our initial 1,000 alpha cards. The Community chipped in with their own designs, and we couldn’t resist sharing them below!

You can view all the community designs on our [**official Discord server**](https://discord.gg/RhxpjpX), too.
