Alan here 👋 I joined Token at the beginning of this month. I thought I’d introduce myself and say a little about what I’ll be doing at Token.

Let’s dive straight in.

### Tell us a little about your background

I’ve been working in Marketing for a little over three years, _all_ of that being within the London fintech startup space, so it’s an environment I know well.

Before taking on the role at Token, I worked at Curve, a financial technology startup. I joined Curve back in 2015, and learned _a lot_ during my time there — working on a range of things from PR & Comms, all the way to User Experience Research and Design (and every conceivable marketing activity between).

When I started at Curve as an intern, the team was eight people and hadn’t yet launched the product. When I left as Product Marketing Manager, the team was over fifty people, and had grown to over 175,000 sign-ups. I’m excited to now bring the skills I’ve learned along the way to Token!

### So, what brought you to Token?

I first came across Token when catching up with [**Anna**](https://medium.com/tokencard/anna-my-first-month-at-token-249a6a77913f) (Head of Marketing) — a few follow-up meetings (and some evenings frantically reading up the world of Ethereum) later, I joined the team!

There were two things in particular that made joining permanently an inevitable — and straightforward — decision.

First up, the **team**. Being in the office environment, it was easy to see that the team had a lot of shared know-how between them, and had a great culture to boot. Moreover, everyone is super committed to what we’re building, which brings me to…

The **product**. The goal of self-sovereign banking, building a tool to help users have _real_ control and ownership over their financial lives, is something that really appeals to me. We’re not out there to build a product for building-a-product’s sake — there’s a social cause mixed in with the technical one, and that’s worth getting excited about.

### What exactly does Product Marketing do?

Generally, Product Marketing means a whole range of things to do with product positioning and messaging, building in customer feedback loops and diving into that data, as well as working out how to get your product out there into the world.

The most important questions for me are about where we sit in our users’ lives — what life _before_ Token looks like, what life _after_ Token will look like, and how we fit into that picture. For now though, I’ll be working on:

**TokenAlpha** 🚀 The whole team are super excited to be onboarding our first community testers onto the iOS Alpha app. I’ll be doing some work on _who_ should be involved in the Alpha, _how_ to get them engaged with the app, and working out _what_ questions we need to have answered ahead of launch.

**Route to Market** 📬 As Soon™ ️[gets closers to Soon_er_™️](https://medium.com/tokencard/soon-step-1-completed-cc2c22bc699b), the Marketing team will be doing a lot of work in preparation for launch — that means identifying the _messages_ that appeal to our potential users, _where_ they hang out, and _how_ best to reach them. A complicated, but fun puzzle to solve.

I can’t wait to get even more stuck into the project — getting to know both the product and our users better, and spreading the Token word. If you want to join me, we’re hiring for _a lot_ of roles. [**Check them out**](https://tokencard.workable.com) and say “hello”. 👋
