Today TokenCard announces a partnership with Contis, the award-winning banking, payments & processing services provider, to issue TokenCard Visa debit cards in the UK and EEA. Users will be able to convert Ethereum and other ERC-20 tokens to load fiat (GBP and EUR) on their debit cards to spend in-store, online, and at ATMs wherever Visa is accepted globally.

Cryptocurrency holders currently struggle with everyday spending; TokenCard solves this problem by offering immediate access to fiat without compromising on the decentralisation that crypto enthusiasts value. TokenCard uniquely has no custodial access to their users‚Äô crypto assets, giving a user full ownership and self-sovereignty.

Crypto holders are looking for a simple and easy solution to use their crypto assets for day-to-day spending. The current process involves multiple steps; moving from wallet to exchange, exchanging, and withdrawing to a bank account, where they often face high FX fees on the transfer. In addition, the process can be lengthy due to SEPA or International transfer times.

TokenCard solves these problems in one step, removing the high costs and friction from this process. Users store their tokens in a fully decentralised, ERC-20 compliant smart contract wallet. They apply for a card via the mobile TokenCard app. TokenCard users convert tokens from their wallet to fiat (GBP/EUR) to load their debit card, which can then be used for standard transactions online or offline just as with any other debit or credit card anywhere Visa is accepted.

TokenCard is launching in the UK & EEA. Users can sign up to be one of the first cardholders via the TokenCard website [**tokencard.io**](https://tokencard.io/) ‚¨áÔ∏è

_‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to be working with Contis and are grateful that they support our mission to realise the value of the emerging token economy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääputting it into the pockets of those who are as passionate about Ethereum and its potential as we are‚Äù Mel Gelderman, TokenCard CEO._

_Flavia Alzetta, CEO Contis said, ‚Äò‚ÄòContis are delighted to work with TokenCard to power their innovative card and banking solution, and in doing so delivering a great customer experience.‚Äù_
