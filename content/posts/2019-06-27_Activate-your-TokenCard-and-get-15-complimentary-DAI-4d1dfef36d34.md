As we move to the next step of our development, we’re putting our ETH where our mouth is. **Now that we’re live on the App Store**, we’re giving back to both our community and for newcomers joining today!

### Get 15 DAI if you’re among the first 1,000 to sign up and activate your TokenCard 💸

Let’s start with a warm welcome to our users, even those who are discovering us for the first time today: **The first 1,000 users will get an exclusive bonus of $15 worth of DAI once they sign-up and activate their TokenCard**!

To apply for a TokenCard, you must be a resident of one of the 31 EEA countries, which includes most of Europe. From us to your letterbox in under ten business days. Activating your card is easy as 1–2–3 — [**here’s how**](https://medium.com/tokencard/start-living-your-life-in-the-ether-with-tokencard-a-10-step-guide-260a977a856d).

The distribution will start next week. Never heard of DAI? Here's the gist: a coin always worth $1. Check [this DAI introduction](https://medium.com/mycrypto/what-is-dai-and-how-does-it-work-742d09ba25d6) to understand how it works and why it's a feat.

### It pays to stick around: TokenCard Alpha users get 50 TKN ($25)

As a “thank you” to all the users who helped us test during the Alpha, we’ve sent them each **50 TKN** to their TokenCard wallets. Anyone who downloaded the app and applied for a card before today (27/06/19) is eligible. The distribution will take place tomorrow.

That will be more than enough to take their TokenCard on a run for an Ethereum-enabled bite to eat!

Whether we’ve you’ve been following us since our crowdsale or you just joined now, we thank you all for making a life on Ethereum possible.

We have more exciting things coming over the next few months — stay tuned! Follow us for updates and drop us a note on the following channels:
