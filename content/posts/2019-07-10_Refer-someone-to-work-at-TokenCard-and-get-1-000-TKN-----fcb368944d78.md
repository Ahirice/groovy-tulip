In the past month, we’ve shipped the TokenCard to the App Store, made huge strides on our Asset Contract, and are edging ever closer to delivering on the TokenCard Whitepaper.

**And we have _really_ exciting plans for the future** — from launching on Android, to expanding our feature set to make ‘life on Ethereum’ real, to acquiring our early users. To get there, we’re building the best team possible.

Today we’re super excited to announce our **hiring referral bonus**! If you refer a friend, colleague, or other amazing folks you know for a role at TokenCard, and we hire them, you’ll get **1,000 TKN** as thanks 💸

If you know a superstar crypto savvy and user-focused [**Customer Operations Specialist**](https://tokencard.workable.com/j/F9EF2A9638?viewed=true), [**blockchain**](https://tokencard.workable.com/j/90F62A3660?viewed=true), [**front-end**](https://tokencard.workable.com/j/24FDC8F978?viewed=true) or [**back-end**](https://tokencard.workable.com/j/06EDF40089?viewed=true) engineers, or a perfect fit for [**any of our open roles**](https://tokencard.workable.com), we’d love to hear from them!

To make a referral please ask the referee to apply directly with their CV to their preferred role in our [**careers page**](https://tokencard.workable.com) adding your name and email in the reference field.

#### The nitty gritty

Got a question? We’ve got the answers — we’ve put some FAQs on our 1,000 TKN hiring referral bonus below. If you have a question that isn’t answered here, drop us a note on [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/tokencard_io).

#### If I refer someone and they’re hired, when do I receive my bonus?

We’ll give out the referral bonus once the person has been hired **and passed their probation**. As soon as your referral has passed their probation period, you’ll get 1,000 TKN!

#### Is there a limit to how many people I can refer?

There is no limit to how many people you can refer — the more the merrier! You can view all of our open roles on our [**Workable careers page**](https://tokencard.workable.com).

#### Do you accept remote workers?

Yes! 10% of the TokenCard team currently work “remote” across Europe. We evaluate remote working on a case-by-case basis and we’re always happy for remote workers to apply for roles.

#### Can I refer myself?

You cannot refer yourself for the 1,000 TKN bonus — even so, if you think you’re a great fit for Team TokenCard, we’d love to hear from you!
