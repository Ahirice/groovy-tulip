We’ve been gearing up to a festive season of testing at Token HQ 🎄

This month we’ve got a host of exciting updates from Product and Engineering. As usual, we’ve added them to the Token Timeline on Product Plan — here are the big updates to look out for:

*   **An update on our Smart Contract audit**
*   **Expanding the Token Alpha**
*   **What’s new in the TokenApp**

### ⛓ An update on our Smart Contract audit

Ensuring that we’re building airtight Smart Contracts is incredibly important to us — in this way, external audits help us to ensure we’re building in a way that is compliant and conducive to keeping users’ funds safe and secure.

Last month, we were able to send our Smart Contract over to **two** external auditors for review. We were really happy with the feedback we received, and have spent good time this month tidying up the code here and there, and addressing edge cases that came up.

We’ve recently spoken a little about the difference in approach between building a “rocket ship” and a traditional “minimum viable product (MVP)”. In the case of MVPs, the aim is to get the product into peoples’ hands as quickly as possible, so that you can iterate as you go. This doesn’t, _and shouldn’t_, apply to Smart Contracts. We see it as more closely aligned to building and launching a rocket ship; NASA need absolute confidence in what they’ve built before lift-off.

### 🎟 Expanding the Token Alpha

At the beginning of this month, 300 of our community members gained early access to the TokenAlpha. In the short time that we’ve been testing, we’ve already seen the following from the Community testers:

→ Tokenauts send assets more than **300** times

→ Tokenauts scan QR codes for easy sending **135** times

→ The card teaser tab tapped **797** times — more than three times per user!

A big priority for the Product team is to onboard more of our Community members onto the Alpha, so that we can get as much feedback as possible — the next big cohort of testers will be brought on once we’ve migrated from our own private testing network, to testnet…

You can keep tabs on the all things Token Alpha in [**our official Discord**](https://discord.gg/RhxpjpX).

### 🚀 What’s new in the TokenApp

On the topic of the TokenAlpha, we’ve released two updates to the app this month — TokenApp **1.6** and **1.7**. Both updates have seen big changes in terms of functionality to “Gas” (how the user determines the processing speed of their transaction) and the “Backup Seed” (how the user can recover their wallet if needed). Elsewhere, we’ve made smaller changes to the UI and the “Whitelist” feature in the app.

[**DanQ has been posting in our Community Forum**](http://discourse.tokencard.io/) with running changelogs (small updates on what’s changed with each app release) — for reach new iOS release we do, we’ll post updates there.

And that’s the major updates from Product and Engineering for November. Next up, we’re looking to get more of our Community using the TokenApp as we move to testnet — watch this space and keep your eyes peeled [@tokencard\_io](https://twitter.com/tokencard_io) on Twitter for updates.

Thanks!
