To all TKN holders,

As you know, Bittrex have announced the delisting of TKN from their platform effective 8th of December. We have been working with their team around the clock to find a way to postpone this whilst we gather the documentation they requested from US lawyers.

As of 3pm GMT, we have not been able to find a suitable solution with the Bittrex team. We donâ€™t have any official confirmation from them, however we believe it is likely the delisting will go ahead on the 8th of December.

To help alleviate concerns and minimize any further impact to TKN holders, we have detailed options available to you below:

1) Bittrex will still allow you to hold TKN on their platform, even if these cannot be traded. For further information, please consult Bittrex [FAQs](https://support.bittrex.com/hc/en-us).

2) If you are still concerned, you may wish to move your TKN out of Bittrex and hold them in a safe place. We have detailed how to do this in a step by step guide available [here](http://tokencard.io/Transferring_TKN_From_Bittrex.pdf).

3) You will still be able to trade TKN until it is delisted on 8th December 2017 should you wish to sell any TKN you currently hold.

4) As reminder, TKN will still be trading on other, less liquid, exchanges such as Liqui, Livecoin, and Etherdelta.

We will continue to work with Bittrex up until the very last possible moment to try to resolve the situation but felt it was important to give TKN holders an update should we not be successful. If the delisting goes ahead, we will do everything in our power to get re-listed in the shortest possible timeframe.

In parallel, we have already kicked off the application process for other major exchanges to expand the range of options available to TKN holders and will keep you updated with the progress.

We know this has been a stressful time for all involved and wish to apologise for any inconvenience caused. There have certainly been some lessons learnt from this challenge and we will improve going forward.

Sincerely,

Mel Gelderman

CEO & Co-founder
