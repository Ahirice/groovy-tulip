Hello Tokenauts 👋 Supporting the first TokenCard Alpha wallet and card users has been the main focus of the Product and Engineering team this month. If you take a look at our official product timeline **@** [**ProductPlan**](https://app.productplan.com/p/WKmCZlrSDYGGdjB9HtBUJZKA9Cl6PCXD), here are the main new things to look out for from April:

1.  **The TokenCard alpha**
2.  **KYC’ing our first users**
3.  **TokenCard EUR cards**
4.  **Smart Contract audits**

#### The TokenCard Alpha

We launched the TokenCard Alpha last month (!), allowing our community — for the first time — to download the TokenCard app and order their card. The response has been amazing, with our community requesting invites in the hundreds, testing the app and sharing their thoughts and feedback along the way. 👉 Want to join in? Sign up at [**tokencard.io/alpha**](https://tokencard.io/alpha/). 👈

As a direct result of the feedback and insight we’ve seen from our Community, we’ve made _a lot_ of positive changes and fixes: tweaking the sign-up flow, making amendments to topping up your card, improving the app’s design, plus a number of bug fixes to make a life on Ethereum that bit more magical.

We’ve also seen a lot of requests from our Community asking for some insight into how many people we’ve invited, how many contracts have been deployed, and more. Here are some headline stats for the TokenCard alpha so far:

💳 500+ invites sent out so far;

💳 200+ Contract Wallets deployed ([**view them live on Etherscan**](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xe0731c1a30e6ed0c6e9162eb87fc85e831caf382));

💳 Users registering interest from 29 countries!

And we’re not done there. We’ll be working to get more Etherians involved in the TokenCard alpha, as well as making it smoother for the people we’ve invited to install, deploy their Contract Wallet, and order their card. It’s going to get even more exciting.

#### KYC’ing our first users

A core element of the TokenCard order process is KYC, or ‘_Know Your Customer_’ — not only does it comprise a big part of our regulatory commitments, but it also allows us to confirm that _you’re really you_, and that _you_ are ordering a TokenCard.

As part of this, the Engineering team have been putting in changes to make the TokenCard app slicker and more accessible; tweaking how we handle addresses, and improving our integration with our various KYC providers.

The Product team have also been taking extra care this month to QA our KYC processors and providers, and — along with the Compliance — team they have been manually reviewing _all_ applications to make sure we’re picking up on the right things. Our longer-term roadmap is to automate this once we’ve _really_ put the process through its paces.

#### TokenCard EUR cards

ICYMI from our Newsletter, the Product and Engineering team also released a huge update for our friends on the Continent: support for Euro (€) as a base currency for your TokenCard! This means that users are now able to pick their preferred currency of EUR (€) or GBP (£) during the card order process.

Wondering what this means for you? EUR TokenCard users won’t encounter fees on domestic POS purchases when spending within the Eurozone. In a nutshell: 1 card, 19 countries, 0 (POS) fees.

#### Smart Contract audits

As our readers and community are aware, investing the time up-front into ensuring our Smart Contract code is not only fit for function, but also watertight, is a major priority. Last month we began an audit process on the entirety of the Smart Contract code, including the code that splits the load into the Community Contribution’s 1% and to our “CryptoFloat”. The output of the audit by the _Trail of Bits_ found no high or critical bugs, which is fantastic news, and the team are working on making the little changes suggested by Trail of Bits — more news on this soon.

The Engineering team are really happy with the findings from the audit. The next step is for us to put the entire repository online, alongside the outputs of the other audits. We’ll update this blog with links, as well as pushing to our wider community, once that’s done.

Being transparent with our community is something we’re super committed to, and this runs from the Marketing efforts you see, to what we’re building at a technical level.

Until next time, happy testing.
