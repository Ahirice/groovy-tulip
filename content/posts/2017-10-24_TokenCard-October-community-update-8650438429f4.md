Here is a round up of what we’ve been up to since our last update.

**WEBSITE LAUNCH**

A few of weeks ago, we launched a new [website](http://tokencard.io) with a completely new design and a new story to tell. With the crowd sale behind us it was time for a refresh as we now want to present our product to the world and engage directly with our community of backers.

We hope you love the design as much as we do and that the new community forum proves to be a useful tool for everyone who wants a direct line to the Token team. This is monitored daily and we look forward to plenty more conversations. If you haven’t visited yet, come say hello on [http://community.tokencard.io](http://community.tokencard.io).

**COMMUNITY EVENT**

On 2 October, the Token team hosted members of the community at a bar on the 39th floor in Canary Wharf. It was interesting to spend the evening talking about blockchain and the new Ethereum economy whilst looking down at traditional banks across the road.  
   
We were delighted to finally introduce our wider team to some of our contributors and have an opportunity to answer their questions. Many asked us insightful questions on our product, and it was great to see members of the community getting to know each other and sharing their own stories. Here are a few pictures from the day:

**UPDATE ON DEVELOPMENT**

The mobile app development is progressing well, as is the back end system to support it. We are kicking off development of the smart contract wallet next week.  
   
Crucially, we are going to begin a second round of user testing next week. User testing means we sit down face to face with a few members of our community and go through the latest app prototype. We use these sessions to gather feedback and make improvements on our designs and user experience. This was incredibly valuable for the product team last time and helped refine what the final product will look like, so we’re excited for this next round. If you are interested in taking part, please do reach out on our [forum](http://community.tokencard.io).

**UPDATE ON CARDS**

We are on track with our card partner for integration of their APIs and delivery of our test cards. In fact our integration is going through load testing at this moment. A few members of the community have requested a card demo, where we would go into a shop to make a purchase with our cards, film it and put it online.  
   
We mentioned this in a [previous blog post](https://medium.com/monolithstudio/tokencard-september-1st-community-update-db02528cb2aa) and to clear up any confusion we want to re-iterate: our card partner requires us to have a User Interface — that means an app store approved feature complete mobile app — before they can issue cards. Therefore before we can carry out such a demo with a card, we need to deliver the mobile app. To achieve this, we are working relentlessly on the app.  
   
Believe us when we say that even we can’t wait to get our hands on our first card and film that magical moment when we pay for our first round of drinks with ETH. As always, our community will be the first to hear about it!
