**UPDATE: snapshot can be found** [**here**](https://github.com/MonolithDAO/token/blob/master/TKN%20holder%20top%201000%20snapshot.pdf)**.**

_For good reason we have decided to handle the distribution of MVP cards slightly differently than originally planned. We have come up with the following procedure to decide who will be able to get an MVP card:_

#### Procedure

1.  On **Monday, May 29th** at 12:00 GMT+1 (Midday, London Time) we will take a snapshot of all TKN [balances](https://etherscan.io/token/TokenCard#balances)_._
2.  The 1000 addresses with the largest TKN balances will be eligible for an MVP card.
3.  **You can easily see if you are _currently_ in the top 1000 here:** [**EtherScan**](https://etherscan.io/token/TokenCard#balances)**.**
4.  Fast forward to the MVP launch in September, you will be able to deploy a smart contract wallet from your top 1000 address and it will be tied to your TokenCard.

#### **Some points to consider:**

*   If you were a crowdsale contributor and received a large enough amount of TKN on your favourite address you are totally fine. No action required.
*   As it currently stands you need 540 TKN or more to be a top 1000 holder but this may change easily leading up to the snapshot. Keep an eye out.
*   If you missed out on the crowdsale, you can buy TKN right now to make sure you are in. Bittrex and Liqui trade TKN.
*   **If you have TKN on an exchange you would need to withdraw it until after the snapshot.** Obviously If you hold a very large amount of TKN you don’t need need to withdraw it all; only enough to be a top 1000 holder.
*   Make sure to put your TKN on the address you will want to use with your TokenCard. If you make a new address please make sure to back it up.
*   Just to reiterate: US and Indian residents won’t be able to receive an MVP TokenCard for now. When that time comes we’ll probably be able to get them a special edition TokenCard.
*   If you are a large holder of TKN please don’t spoil the fun for others by splitting up your TKN. This wouldn’t be good for you or the project.

#### Rationale

There are a number of reasons we’ve decided to handle the situation like this and we believe it is a much better solution than what we originally had in mind.

*   People can prepare and use the address they eventually want to launch their Contract Wallet from.
*   Plenty of people sent from an exchange during the crowdfund.
*   There were many edge cases with the original model. Lots of people would be disappointed they didn’t get in.
*   Some people sent one large communal transaction. These TKN would likely have been distributed at this point.
*   Some weak hands dumped and exited the community.
*   People who missed the crowdsale and desperately wanted the MVP card now have the chance to do so by buying TKN on the [Exchange](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-TKN).
