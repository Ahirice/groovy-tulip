ETHLDN is the place where ethereal builders meet and share their experiences. The [latest edition](https://www.meetup.com/ethereum/events/260992086/) delved into different ways to secure users‚Äô keys and accesses, be they custodial (Trustology) or not (TokenCard). Lawrence from Extropy then concluded the session with a deep dive into an interesting consensus mechanism designed to increase the energy-efficiency of private-chains.

### Mischa Tuffield‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLiving a Life on¬†Ethereum

Mischa likes imagining and building towards a better future; he has spent his life contributing to open standards and is now focusing his time and attention on building a brighter future on top of Ethereum. He thinks computers **are** fun and interesting, and **loves** to share his passion:

Mischa Tuffield from TokenCard at ETHLDN

In his talk, Mischa addresses the different challenges TokenCard faced developing a credible and non-custodial alternative to consumer banking. In the light of the [latest Binance hack](https://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-withdraw-7-000-bitcoins-in-binance-crypto-exchange-security-breach), he restated the benefits of keeping control of your funds at all times, and the necessity for non-custodial services. He also explored how to go even further: opening up the experience and making it participatory.

### Dominic Longman‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe Future Role of Custodian

Dominic has extensive experience with payments and financial services. He addressed the current weaknesses in the cryptocurrency ecosystem that will need to be addressed to attract institutional money. Offering credible custodial solutions to safeguard asserts (and have an interlocutor to speak with in case anything goes south) is just one block in the mesh of financial services required to match the possibilities offered old banking world.

Dominic Longman from Trustology at ETHLDN

Dominic did a great job at reframing custody within the greater scheme of financial services before diving into the problems solved by Trustology‚Äôs offering solutions for both individual and organisations.

### Lawrence Kirk‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäProof of Kernel¬†Work

After a successful career writing low latency financial applications in the City of London, Laurence was captivated by the potential of distributed ledger technology and made the jump: he set up Extropy, a blockchain consultancy group.

Lawrence Kirk from Extropy at ETHLDN

Looking at the current weaknesses of Proof of Work, Lawrence offers an alternative designed for private networks. He focused on reducing the energy consumption of the mechanism. Thanks to the committee (built with sortition), the mining effort is more concentrated than in Proof of Work, reducing the overall usage of the system.

Designed with small devices in mind, PoKW is able to dramatically reduce the consumption as well as the hardware requirements compared to PoW. PoKW uses a committee to make the "work" of the PoW component more targeted and efficient. PokW nodes can even go in sleep mode when they‚Äôre not needed if the sortition is deterministic.

#### Learn more about¬†Extropy
