Hi Tokenauts! Welcome to our June newsletter — it’s a whopper. This month we cover launching on the App Store, how **_you_** could get free DAI and TKN with TokenCard, plus a special hiring referral bonus. **Let’s dive right in**.

#### **TokenCard, now on the App Store 🍏**

This month we brought life on Ethereum to the App Store! As of now, anyone in the UK and European Economic Area (_that’s 31 countries across Europe_) with an iPhone can download the TokenCard app on iOS ([**_tweet this_**](https://tokencard.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a08825d6fe73df28f11896631&id=9b120f186e&e=c804d3727c)).

And the good news doesn’t stop there. We’re giving the first **1,000** people to download the TokenCard app and activate their card will get **15 DAI** FREE, sent straight to their TokenCard Wallet. [**Get started here**](https://apps.apple.com/app/tokencard/id1389841315).

#### **We’re live on Product Hunt 😻**

To celebrate our App Store launch, [**we’re now live on Product Hunt**](https://tokencard.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a08825d6fe73df28f11896631&id=2c52e87fcf&e=c804d3727c), _the_ go-to place on the web for discovering the best new products. Check out our entry, and share your feedback on the app — what you like, what you want to see changed, and anything else you’d like to tell us about the app and card.

#### **Alpha tester? Check your TokenCard Wallet 👀**

We’re on a journey to empower our people around the world to live their life on Ethereum. For certain, we could not have realised this without your fiery support and great commitment.

As a small token of our thanks to Alpha testers who downloaded the app and applied for a card, last week **we loaded their accounts with 50 TKN**! Mel was there to capture the moment we paid out the TKN to our early adopters.

#### **Get swapping with Uniswap 🦄**

Last week we added **1000 ETH worth of TKN to Uniswap**, making TKN the 4th most liquid market on the platform, placing us right between **DAI** and **TUSD**! This was due to high demand from both our own Community _and_ the wider Uniswap user base.

Start swapping today at [**uniswap.exchange**](https://tokencard.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a08825d6fe73df28f11896631&id=556c975f57&e=c804d3727c).

#### Ask us anything 💬

We’re firmly in the Summer of TokenCard. App Store, DAI pay-outs, and growing the team — and we have no intention of slowing down. Now, we’d like to hear from our community; we’d like to hear from _you._

To round off the month, we hosted a Twitter AMA with Mel, CEO and co-founder of TokenCard. **Catch up on the AMA below** ⬇️

See you next month! — Team TokenCard
