The first TokenCards have been making their way to our community around the UK and 30 European countries over the past month or so — from London to Ljubljana, we’ve been painting the town _TokenCard_\-Green.

It’s been amazing to see our Community taking to Twitter and posting their unboxing videos, pictures, and feedback. We couldn’t resist sharing our favourites so far… 👀

Looking to grab a sweet TokenCard 💳 of your own? [📩 Sign-up to the alpha](https://tokencard.io/alpha/)

#### Step through the monolith 🚶

The first cards are rolling out to our Community in some suitably on-brand TokenCard-Green packaging — hand numbered and signed from Mel and David, our co-founders.

❗️The highest number we’ve seen posted so far is **#100**. Got a TokenCard number higher than that? Share it with us on Twitter ([**tokencard\_io**](https://twitter.com/tokencard_io)) for those crypto bragging rights.

“SUPER DUPER PUMPED”. So are we… 💪

…and on the seventh day, even Jesus was on-hand to share his unboxing experience with us. Although this time, he’s turning ETH into Fiat:

#### A tale of two voiceovers 📣

When you think of voiceovers, the greats come to mind — Morgan Freeman, Patrick Stewart, the voice of Siri…

Now you might add “_The TokenCard Community_” to that list. Twitter user **FINSCHER** added some spice to their unboxing experience with a custom laugh track:

Meanwhile, **Mobster Cat** went a little more… _cinematic_ with their unboxing:

Which video comes out on top? **You decide**.

#### Make mine a… ❓ ❓ ❓

Your TokenCard arrives. You activate it in the app by tapping the Card “ 💳 ” tab. You top it up with ETH, DAI, or TKN. Now the real question arises:

> **Just what do I buy first…?**

Leading Ethereum podcaster **Crypto Authority** (🔌 check out TokenCard CEO Mel’s chat with Crypto Authority [**on Spotify**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OxTegeVBp5XrBmwhBOeTf?si=9XZfiRnrTVCWgfkrNYyjrA)) went for a refreshing duo — a sandwich and an ice latte.

“_Nothing says independence louder than living the decentralised dream._” We couldn’t have put it better ourselves.

Meanwhile, Team TokenCard have been opting for a classic caffeine fix — this coffee’s on crypto.

Got your alpha card through the post? We’d love to hear from you.

Share your unboxing experience and your first purchases with us on [🐦 **Twitter**](https://twitter.com/tokencard_io), or post in our official Community [🎮 **Discord** ](https://discord.gg/YrrFpFd)— you might just earn yourself some TokenCard swag in the process.
