Welcome to our May newsletter — and boy, is it jam-packed. From the first TokenCard Alpha cards making their way to our Community, to how we’re shaking up consumer finance with just 2,500 lines of code, to a **_very_** special update.

Here’s what’s new this month.

#### TokenCard Alpha, out of the box 📦

In case you missed it, the TokenCard Alpha is live! Last month we launched to our Community, giving them the chance to get their hands on the first TokenCard Visa Debit cards. **This is living a life on Ethereum**.

Want to get your hands on TokenCard? All you need is an iPhone and to be a resident in the UK or EEA. Don’t miss out — _anyone_ can sign up today at [**tokencard.io/alpha**](https://tokencard.io/alpha/) to receive an invite this week!

#### Mischa on “The Bank of Tomorrow” ⛓

![](/images/1__0cmgOUyAyPUA5uhkcuS3kg.png)

We believe that the business of consumer banking is in direct conflict with consumer interests. The profit made by consumer banks from consumer deposits is redirected away from the consumers to the bank’s benefit. This is broken.

We’re fixing this customer relationship with just 2,500 lines of code. Our CTO Mischa reveals all on how, [**elsewhere on our blog** →](https://medium.com/tokencard/does-the-bank-of-tomorrow-hold-no-funds-ef3ceb56d709)

#### TokenCard @ ETHLDN 📆

ETHLDN is the place to be for BUIDLers on Ethereum. Early this month, we were invited to present on the theme of the night, which delved into different ways to secure users’ keys and access, be they custodial (such as Trustology) or non-custodial (that’s us, TokenCard).

In his talk, Mischa addresses the different challenges we’ve faced in making a life on Ethereum possible — developing a credible and non-custodial alternative to consumer banking.

#### We’re Listening to: Crypto Authority Podcast 📣

This month we caught up with Crypto Authority — a leading podcast on digital assets and the blockchain industry. Mel was on-hand to discuss how TokenCard stands out from the crowd, and what it really means to create the world’s first decentralised crypto-powered debit card.

Plug in, and tune out to Mel’s dulcet tones — [**listen on Spotify →**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4OxTegeVBp5XrBmwhBOeTf?si=9XZfiRnrTVCWgfkrNYyjrA)

#### …and a Final Note on Android 🤖

Those of you who follow us on Twitter **@**[**tokencard.io**](http://twitter.com/tokencard_io) will have noticed some interesting replies to people asking about Android. We’re excited to announce that we’ve ramped up development of the TokenCard App on Android! The work at the moment is focussed around Android security research, plus putting the foundations in place from a coding perspective. Stay tuned.
