Welcome to March’s newsletter! From testing and talking about the card, to our Community Meet-up, it’s been a big month. Here’s what we’ve been up to:

#### An Update on TokenCard Shipping

We’d like to start this newsletter off with an update on launching the TokenCard and Contract Wallet out to the world. We’ve had to push the date back and we want you to understand why.

The recent delay is down to amendments we are making to the Contract Wallet, the aim of which is to improve usability and make it future-proof. To date, the version of the Contract Wallet application that we have been using has been an ERC-20-only wallet. Currently, for example, it cannot create DAI by collateralising ETH through the Maker CDP. Given feedback and our knowledge of the market, not being able to work with the CDP was deemed something we needed to address — we’ve been making changes to ensure that it does.

If we were to go live with the current Contract Wallet, users would have to redeploy their Contract Wallet once the newer version had been released. This is a sub-optimal experience for our community, and given that the delay will be a short rather than extended one we’ve decided that it’s better for us to push back the Contract Wallet launch.

We’re sorry for any frustrations caused by this and will keep you updated on our progress on this front. You can read the full update — including info on fees, and how we’ll be onboarding ICO participants — [**elsewhere on our blog**](https://medium.com/tokencard/tokencard-update-timings-fees-shipping-43317db5612b).

#### TokenCard March Meet-up

Last week we hosted our first Community Meet-up of the year! Mel and Mischa took to the stage to talk all things TokenCard, before the Team and Community caught up over drinks. It was great to put faces to names, and meet so many of our Community members.

Weren’t able to make it on the night? [**Catch up on the talks on Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkAvpqrb3b0&list=PLimDUDoPGQcmvLfCd5bTjloQuDXvP9uei).

Stay up-to-date on when and where we’re hosting our next event — [**join the TokenCard Community on meetup.com**](https://meetup.com/TokenCard-Meets/).

#### TokenCard in Action

From ETH, to GBP, to your morning coffee. We’ve spent the past month over [**@tokencard\_io**](https://twitter.com/tokencard_io) taking the TokenCard for a spin as part of our ongoing “**Testing Diary**” — you can view the first purchase with TokenCard below.

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be introducing you to self-sovereign banking in action — from taking the card out for everyday purchases, to diving under the hood of the Contract Wallet. Stay tuned.
