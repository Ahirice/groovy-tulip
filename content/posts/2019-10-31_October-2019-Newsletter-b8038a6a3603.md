Welcome to our October newsletter!

With the release of Android, our presence at DevCon and some of the newest tokens we’ve now made spendable on our card — this month was packed. 💪

Let’s dive right in!

#### Monolith is now live on Android! 🤖

We’ve all been waiting for it and now it’s happened: as of last week, Android is now live! Anyone with a device supporting Android 7 (Nougat) and higher can now go bankless!

#### 🆕 New tokens to top-up your card

We’ve enabled card top-ups with iExec’s RLC token, Circle’s USDC and a few others!

As of today, we now have ten tokens spendable on the Monolith Card, and we keep on adding tokens: it might be eleven by the time this email reaches you!

#### 🌌 Shining at DevCon

Monolith’s stand at DevCon was a busy place! Attending this event enabled us to pitch to hundreds of Ethereum enthusiasts over the four days of the event.

We came away from this event having made connections, discovered fascinating new projects and exchanged ideas with the broader community.  
It was a blast; the whole team can’t wait for the next edition!

Before the release, we would hear almost daily: “when Android?”  
Our product team has taken the opportunity to address the many questions we’ve been receiving over the past months, especially around the Android release. We hope we enjoy this special blog post written by our product team:

Thanks, and see you next month!
