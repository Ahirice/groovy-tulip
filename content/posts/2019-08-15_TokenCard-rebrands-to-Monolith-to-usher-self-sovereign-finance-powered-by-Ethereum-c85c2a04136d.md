We are thrilled to announce that TokenCard’s rebranding to Monolith. This rebrand represents the next evolution of the company, one which doesn’t just include a new name, but also comes with many exciting new features and additions.

We’ve been talking about the "Summer of Monolith" for a while, now it’s time for the fireworks! 🎆

Without further ado, let’s dive into all the exciting news we couldn’t wait to share:

#### 🌟 Glimmering partnerships!

We are partnering with MakerDAO and Digix to bring Decentralised Finance (Defi) to the world. **You can now top-up your Monolith cards with MKR, DGX and DGD**, along with our original suite of tokens: DAI, ETH and TKN.

To celebrate this premiere, we will be giving away free DGX to our amazing community: you can find [more details about the DGX bonuses here.](https://medium.com/monolith/monolith-partners-with-digix-to-make-digital-gold-spendable-anywhere-and-we-are-giving-away-free-3eb887a847d8) It’s time to spend some gold!

Mel and Shaun Djie, Digix’s co-founder, will meet in Berlin during the Web3 Conference to go over the partnership and discuss all things Ethereum. Save the date: **📅 Tuesday, August 20 at 10 AM\[ GMT + 2\]**

#### 🏡 All tokens under one roof

We now support the **most popular ERC-20 tokens in the Monolith wallet!** Our goal is to eventually cover them all and we have a number of announcements coming down the pipeline — so watch this space!

#### 💳 Monolith Branded Cards

Let’s not forget about the service that enables the spending of ETH & ERC-20 in the real world, today, at more than 65M+ point of sales worldwide: our Monolith Visa Debit cards!

It was about time to get them to look the part — they are unique and unparalleled after all, and now so is their design:

Oh, and by the way, the Monolith cards support Google Pay.

#### 🧬 A new style, straight from the Ether

The cards are not the only ones getting a face-lift! We’ve updated our branding assets on all our main channels, as we’ve worked tirelessly to create a visual identity that is authentic, provocative, and bold enough to embody our vision of decentralised and trustless future.

#### Why Monolith?

The concept of Monolith stemmed from Arthur C. Clarke’s novel 2001: A Space Odyssey, where it represents mankind transcending into a new era. To us, Ethereum is the real-life analogy to the Monolith and it alludes to transcendence in the world economy through the introduction of Decentralised Finance (DeFi).

Our project, Monolith, brings Ethereum to life.

#### What’s next?

Our transition to Monolith is a significant milestone in our development, yet the journey is just beginning. We are working on many exciting projects — and we can’t wait to show you!
