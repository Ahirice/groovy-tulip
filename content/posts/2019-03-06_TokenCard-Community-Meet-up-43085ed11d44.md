### A note from DanQ, our Community Manager

_Hello all, it’s finally happening! I’m super excited to be planning the meet up for you all, and I hope you enjoy it! I’ve been looking at venues, making merch, looking at the drinks menu, and making sure everything is coherent and on-brand for this event!_**—** DanQ

### Running order for the evening

We’ll be opening up doors at 6:30PM (GMT), and we’ll start the evening’s talks shortly after, around 7PM. Co-founders, Mel and David, will kick-off the event, talking a little about _why_ we’re building what we’re building here at TokenCard. You will also hear from the Marketing, Tech, and Product teams throughout the evening.

We want to hear from you, too! Think of some good questions, as each presentation will allow for a short Q&A at the end 🤔

Once we’ve wrapped up the talks for the evening, we’ll be heading downstairs to the bar — snacks and drinks will be provided.

### How do I get tickets?

⚠️ _Don’t forget, we have a 60 person MAX capacity_ ⚠️

We’ll be hosting our event on [**Kickback**](https://kickback.events/event/0x5bdb6c02ed135f9182241912b69efd76b6859892), the blockchain meet-up platform. Our Full Stack Developer, Ramesh, has created this great meet-up platform, and it makes perfect sense for us to use it. Here’s how it works:

1.  You pledge an amount of ETH, set by the event organiser, as your RSVP;
2.  You are marked either “in attendance” at the event, or “no show”;
3.  If you pledged and did not attend, your ETH pledge goes into a pool that is split between those who did attend.
4.  If you did attend, you’ll get your ETH back, plus a small portion of the ETH pledged from no-shows.
5.  You have a set amount of time after the event to withdraw your ETH pot.

Let’s put some skin in the game. [**Get your tickets for the meet-up today**](https://kickback.events/event/0x5bdb6c02ed135f9182241912b69efd76b6859892)!
